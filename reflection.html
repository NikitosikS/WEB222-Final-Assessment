      <h4 id="reflect">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive Design is the web page design that provides excellent experience on a variety of devices connected to the internet. This means that the same page can be viewed on a variety of devices, regardless of resolution and screen format - smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc. At the same time, browsing will be equally convenient for all formats. Nowadays, there are many devices that people use in order to access the Internet. All of these devices differ in screen size and resolution. Therefore, it is important for the websites to look good and display correct information on any device. Thanks to the responsive design and the growing popularity of smartphones, the online of the website can increase significantly.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my responsive design I used some important techniques. First of all, most values were set as a percentage. Since, screen size and resolution changes depending on the device, it is nearly impossible to guess accurately, for example, what size you need to insert pictures so that they do not go beyond the screen or how big the text should be. I also made some objects relative to others, so if the main object changes size, all relatives will also change their size. It is important to use 'word-wrap' property so that words do not go off the screen. Despite the fact that I didn't use hamburger (dropdown menu which looks like 3 parallel small lines), as a smartphone user I can say that this method is really comfortable.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general I want to say that, depends on the website, responsive design can be very difficult. If you want to create a good responsive design, you should take into account many factors such as browser, different devices...</h4>
